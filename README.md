# palanca-copycat-ts

this is the same project as the one in my repo but uses typescript and tailwind instead of normal js and mui repectively

# disclaimer

this is not my idea. this is only a recreation of another's work for educational purposes. also I'm noob and I have no idea about half the sh*t im typing here, at least for the ts part :(
